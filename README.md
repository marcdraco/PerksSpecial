Custom PCB for the JLI2555 Capsule 
After long delays in my redesign of Matthew Perks’ excellent USB 3.0 microphone, I’m releasing this very simple design that will work with many TO92 and TO71 JFETs.

It’s primarily designed with the LSK170(a-c) or the LSK389 but should also work with any low-voltage JFETs designed for condenser microphone applications.

ALL three (technically four) devices are wired in parallel as can be seen in the schematic, but you should only fit one appropriate to the device you have. I recommend that LSK170 which is low noise, in current production and not especially expensive.

The name tag should break right off if you want to- the silkscreen doesn't have the part numbers as there are a fair number in different packages that will also work (to some degree). 

JLC PCB will assemble the board for you complete with the two small (402) 2k2 SMD resistors for next to nothing which is why I didn't make them through hole.
